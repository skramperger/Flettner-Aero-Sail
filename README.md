## Features
- **Flettner Rotor Propulsion**: Innovative propulsion mechanism.
- **ESP32 Communication**: Wi-Fi-based interaction between boat and controller.
- **Sensor Integration**: Environmental data collection (temperature, humidity, wind speed).
- **Custom Controller**: Joystick and button controls with OLED display for telemetry.

## Technologies Used
- ESP32 WROOM 32
- Custom Plexiglas Controller with an integrated OLED Display
- 3D-Printed Components
